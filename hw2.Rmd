#HW 2 - La Quinta is Spanish for Next to Denny's#
Team 4 - Duke Dinosaurs \newline
Due: Oct 14, 2015 \newline
##La Quinta##
##Denny's##
To obtain all the Denny's locations in the US, we started by using a website called freemaptools to draw circles around parts of the US. With five circles, we should be covering all of US.
  
```
   Longitude Latitude Radius.Miles
1 -113.90625 40.64997          788
2  -95.44922 38.01140          851
3  -84.90234 38.88282         1056
4 -157.14844 20.82924          438
5 -141.67969 59.06586         1053
```
The first two columns tells us where the center of our circles are located. Radius.Miles tells us the radius of our circles in miles.
