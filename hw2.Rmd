#HW 2 - La Quinta is Spanish for Next to Denny's#
Team 4 - Duke Dinosaurs \newline
Due: Oct 14, 2015 \newline
##La Quinta##
##Denny's##
To obtain all the Denny's locations in the US, we started by using a website called freemaptools to draw circles around parts of the US. With five circles, we should be covering all of US.
  
```
   Longitude Latitude Radius.Miles
1 -113.90625 40.64997          788
2  -95.44922 38.01140          851
3  -84.90234 38.88282         1056
4 -157.14844 20.82924          438
5 -141.67969 59.06586         1053
```
The first two columns tells us where the center of our circles are located. Radius.Miles tells us the radius of our circles in miles. These coordinates and radii will be stored in dennys_coords.csv so it can be used in the next step.\newline
Now, in `get_dennys.R`, we'll extract the location data from `hosted.where2getit.com/dennys`. We get the locations in such a way because Denny's uses the third-party Where2GetIt API to display their restaurant locations. It will take the circle centers and radii specified in `dennys_coords.csv` to search for all locations within the radius of that circumference. We first specified the key, which Denny's uses, to access Where2GetIt API. Next, we limited the number of results to be 1,000. Now, `dennys_coords.csv` will have the longitude and latitude of the circle centers, as well as the search radius. Since we have five circles, we will run through the function five times using a ForLoop. The information will be stored as an .xml file under the dennys directory inside our data directory. \newline
Finally, we can construct a data frame with the details of each denny's location. We'll find the longitude, latitude, postal code, address, city, country, state, and unique id of each location. Since our circles overlap, we may have some locations listed multiple times. We'll use `unique` so that we only have each location listed once. \newline
Now that we have information on all Denny's locations in the US, it's possible to do distance analysis.
